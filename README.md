# introducton-of-sentiment-analysis-in-python
this is an introduction of sentiment analysis in python. in this jupyternote book, the first part is called Analyze sentiment with dictionary.
we create our own positive/negative dictionary, in order to conduct sentiment in our database.
we use a naive or simple method to decide whether the massage in our database is positive or negative, we count the pos/neg words in that massage, if more possitive words, then the whole massage is positive!
this is just a basic method, you can build your own!
in the next part, we use NLTK to do sentiment analysis. we use vador.
in the last part, you can build your own term frequency.
all the outputs have visualization.
